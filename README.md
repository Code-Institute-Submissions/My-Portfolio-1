# Hello and welcome,

This is the professional portfolio for myself, Michael Sallam. In this readme file I shall explain a few aspects of my portfolio page and give some brief insight into what makes it tick. 

So far, this project has only been built using CSS and HTML, however it will be updated with relevant Javescript as I continue through my Full Stack Software Development course. Currently it shall also link to some other side projects that are part of my course. I shall be updating and personalising them more as time goes on, so for now they can be considered as WIPs.

Thanks for reading, now if you haven't already, check out the page. Feedback on layout and design is welcomed!

Cheers, 
Michael S.
