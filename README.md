# Hello and welcome,

This is the professional portfolio for myself, Michael Sallam. In this readme file I shall explain a few aspects of my portfolio page and give some brief insight into what makes it tick. 

So far, this project has only been built using CSS and HTML, however it will be updated with relevant Javescript as I continue through my Full Stack Software Development course. Currently it shall also link to some other side projects that are part of my course. I shall be updating and personalising them more as time goes on, so for now they can be considered as WIPs.

Thanks for reading, now if you haven't already, check out the page. Feedback on layout and design is welcomed!

Thanks, 
Michael S.

This project in it's current state does not reflect my ability. 
At present it lacks any extensive detail and is not currntly what I would like it to be, 
moving forward there will be extensive testing completed by myself as I have a small group of friend's and family that wish to view my work to help me do so.

Currently the only real function is the navigation bar, I am submitting it in this state because I intend to finish this course strongly and part of that was overcoming the anxiety
of doing my first project, since I left higher education 2 years ago. I know it will initially be a failure but I look forward to making it better and to my future projects.
